Hi! I am a research assistant at the [Ibero-Amerika Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung](https://uni-goettingen.de/en/64104.html) at the [Georg-August-Universität Göttingen](https://uni-goettingen.de/). I also serve as a researcher to the United Nations University's project [Managing Exits from Armed Conflict](https://cpr.unu.edu/research/projects/meac.html#outline). Before this I was a data analyst at the [Regional Office for Central America, North America and the Caribbean of the International Organization for Migration (IOM)](https://rosanjose.iom.int/en), and a statistical consultant at the [UN Women's Global Centre of Excellence on Gender Statistics (CEGS)](https://data.unwomen.org/where-we-work/cegs) and the [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's Center of Excellence for Statistical Information on Government, Crime, Victimization and Justice (CdE-UNODC)](https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/en/). 

I am passionate about analyzing data on poverty, crime, violence, conflict, and gender inequalities. I love building non-parametric models applied to high-dimensional data sets on these topics. I work with R. Prueba 1 de muchas 

Outside of work, I love watching cinearte and independent movies (see my top 5), reading (see my top 5), listening music, walking, traveling, and spending time with the wonderful human beings I have met in my life.
