The dataset contains information on 70 infectious diseases and 2227 public health events that occurred over the period from January 1996 to March 2022 in 233 countries and territories around the world. We illustrate the potential use of this dataset to the research community by analysing the spatial distribution of disease outbreaks. We find evidence of spatial clusters of high incidences (“hot spots”) in Africa, America, and Asia. This spatial analysis enables policymakers to identify the regions with the greatest likelihood of suffering from disease outbreaks and, taking into account their degree of preparedness and vulnerability, to develop policies that may help contain the spreading of future outbreaks. Further applications could focus on combining our data with other information sources to study, for instance, the link between environmental, globalization, and/or socioeconomic factors with disease outbreaks.","tags":[],"title":"A global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Torres Munguía","Inmaculada Martínez-Zarzoso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1644278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644278400,"objectID":"839570077a863bc94bfabddb3bb6e2d9","permalink":"http://example.org/publication/ipv/","publishdate":"2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ipv/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this paper is to identify the risk factors for emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) against women and girls with children in Mexico from an ecological perspective. To that end, we generate a dataset with 35,004 observations and 42 covariates, to which we apply an additive probit model estimated with a boosting algorithm to overcome high-dimensionality and simultaneously perform variable selection and model choice. The dataset integrates 10 information sources, allowing us to properly characterize the four levels of the ecological approach, which is the first contribution of this paper. In addition, there are three key contributions. First, we identify a number of factors significantly linked to emotional IPV against women with children: age, age at sexual initiation, age at marriage (or cohabitation), autonomy regarding professional issues, social support networks, division of housework, the community’s Gini index, women’s economic participation in the municipality, and the prevalence of crime against males in the region. Second, we discuss some risk factors whose effects have not been examined or have been underexplored for Mexico; these include women’s decision-making autonomy, social support networks, distribution of housework, the community’s economic inequality, and criminality. Third, we identify specific risk subgroups that are generally overlooked: women who had their first sexual intercourse during childhood and women who got married (or moved in together with a partner) late in life. The main results suggest that strategies aiming to promote women’s social and economic empowerment and reduce criminality should also incorporate a gender component regarding emotional violence against women with children in the context of intimate relationships.","tags":[],"title":"Determinants of Emotional Intimate Partner Violence against Women and Girls with Children in Mexican Households:  An Ecological Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Torres Munguía","Inmaculada Martínez-Zarzoso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635984000,"objectID":"6af1cd35f42fba1b4cd538bc6a9314e6","permalink":"http://example.org/publication/poverty/","publishdate":"2021-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/poverty/","section":"publication","summary":"According to 2016 official estimates, almost 60% of the rural population in Mexico (16.9 million people) had income levels below the poverty line, and approximately 29.2% (8.3 million) could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families. Focusing on identifying heterogeneous effects according to the sex of the household head, we apply additive quantile models to a cross-sectional dataset containing information on 4,434 women-headed and 14,877 men-headed households. For each model, we introduce 45 variables at the individual/household, community, and regional levels. Two major contributions emerge from this paper. First, the identification of a subset of significant factors whose effect is independent of the head’s sex and is relevant for poor and extremely poor families. This is found for the variables credit card ownership, access to basic housing services, education level, and satisfaction with public services. Second, results also identify a subset of significant factors with an uneven effect on income according to the sex of the head that is observed both in the poor and extremely poor households. Variables having this gendered effect are the community’s income inequality, municipal human development, social networks, access to social security, and gender-based violence against women in the public sphere. Out of these, particularly relevant is the effect of the last three factors, whose association with income has not been explored before for rural Mexico and for which the bias among sexes increases as family income grows from extreme poverty to poverty level.","tags":[],"title":"Examining gender inequalities in factors associated with income poverty in Mexican rural households","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Torres Munguía","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
