# Hello! Thanks for passing by my site.

My name is Juan Armando. I am a Statistician specialized in the management, analysis, and visualization of data related to humanitarian emergencies and most vulnerable populations.

My work integrates statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data science techniques to better understand how individuals, families, and communities experience, adapt to, and cope with phenomena such as armed conflict, violence, climate change, poverty, and displacement.

As an R-enthusiast, I love coding to optimize and streamline my work. Check out my [Blog](https://juan-torresmunguia.netlify.app/blog/), where I share insights on using R for the study of humanitarian and development data.

> [!NOTE]
I am open to collaborations on publications, research, data analysis, data visualization, and related development and humanitarian data projects, and I am always happy to talk about this and share ideas.
